# Hands-On Internet of Things with Blynk
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Internet of Things with Blynk](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-internet-things-blynk?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788995061), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
This book uses Raspberry Pi as the main hardware platform and C/C++ to write sketches to build projects. The first part of this book shows how to set up a development environment with various hardware combinations and required software. Then you will build your first IoT application with Blynk using various hardware combinations and connectivity types such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Then you'll use and configure various widgets (control, display, notification, interface, time input, and some advanced widgets) with Blynk App Builder to build applications. Towards the end, you will learn how to connect with and use built-in sensors on Android and iOS mobile devices. Finally you will learn how to build a robot that can be controlled with a Blynk app through the Blynk cloud and personal server.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:

```
BLYNK_WRITE(V1)

{

intpinValue = param.asInt(); // assigning value on Virtual Pin (V1) to a variable

// process received value

}
```
